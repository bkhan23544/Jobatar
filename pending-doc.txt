    Job details – payment details - does not show

    Job – send proposal – place a bid –
    how would you like to pay for this job – change to – How would you like to get paid for this job?
    How much would you like to pay for this job? – change to - How much would you like to get paid for this job?

    We need to go over the workflow for my bids – we are supposed to put this under offers – jobs
    Received job proposal – submit offer button – change to – Submit Counteroffer
    Job proposal – message button- it opens to another

    Job proposal – freelancer view – after the job provider submits a counter – the freelancer should just either accept or decline – please remove the submit counter offer button
    Contracts – job – would you like to mark this timesheet as complete – change the label of the button from “submission” to “yes”
    Contracts – job – duration – we need to put hours as measurement of duration
    Contracts – job – timesheet details – duration and deadline does not appear
    Contracts – job – when a job is moved here we should change the label from “Job proposal” to “Active Job”
    Contracts – job – when a job is moved here we should change the label from “bidder info” to “Freelancer info”
    Contracts – job – when a timesheet is submitted to the job provider – there is no button to approve it
    Contracts – job – there is no button to mark the job contract as complete
    Browse freelancers – freelancer profile – we need to add a button so that any member can invite a freelancer to bid on their posted jobs
    Top header search bar – freelancers and cofounders not working when I perform a search
    Top header search bar – please have the search label appear when selected – see screenshot – also make the font smaller
    search bar.PNG
    Messaging – after one day – instead of time stamp – we need to put the date
    Drop down menu categories when you click on the image on upper right corner – Change the font from bold to regular and make the font a bit smaller

    Homepage header- “HOW IT WORKS” – change from bold to regular

    Browse for jobs- too much space for each posting – payment type – please move it on the first row after categories

    Browse for jobs – job results – please make all the font smaller - specially the job title
