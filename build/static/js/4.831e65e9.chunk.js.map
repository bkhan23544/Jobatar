Services provided through the Site are not guaranteed or warranted and Users must always use caution and common sense when entering into a transaction and always inspect other users.</p>\r\n<p className=\"pb-2\">\r\nJoBarter takes no position and offers no opinion on when or if a contractual agreement or other relationship is formed between the User and other users of the Site or other parties or when delivery occurs. In order to provide an optimal forum for the User, the Site does not involve itself in the agreements between the User and other users of the Site or the actual delivery or provision or delivery of goods or services of the User or other users of the Site, third parties, or any other person or entity. Therefore, the Site cannot ensure the completion of any agreement, representation, warranty, or the integrity of any party.

If the User has a dispute with one or more other users of the Site, the Users release the Site from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n <h2> Modifications to Agreements</h2>\r\n<p className=\"pb-2\">You can see when this Agreement was last updated by viewing the relevant date on the top left of this page.
