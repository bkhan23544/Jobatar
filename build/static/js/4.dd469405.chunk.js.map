The Site is intended to assist Users in identifying those who are interested in sending or obtaining Post Data (as defined herein). The Site acts as an online venue.

Services provided through the Site are not guaranteed or warranted and Users must always use caution and common sense when entering into a transaction and always inspect other users.</p>\r\n<p className=\"pb-2\">\r\nJoBarter takes no position and offers no opinion on when or if a contractual agreement or other relationship is formed between the User and other users of the Site or other parties or when delivery occurs. In order to provide an optimal forum for the User, the Site does not involve itself in the agreements between the User and other users of the Site or the actual delivery or provision or delivery of goods or services of the User or other users of the Site, third parties, or any other person or entity. Therefore, the Site cannot ensure the completion of any agreement, representation, warranty, or the integrity of any party. The Site will not be a party to any fee or referral fee dispute or other related legal matter, or claim asserted by or amongst the User or other users of the Site. If the User has a dispute with one or more other users of the Site, the Users release the Site from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n <h2> Modifications to Agreements</h2>\r\n<p className=\"pb-2\">You can see when this Agreement was last updated by viewing the relevant date on the top left of this page.

JoBarter only receives this Service Fee when a Client and a Freelancer pay and receive payment through the Site. Therefore, for 6 months from the time you identify or are identified by any party through the Site (the \"<b>Non-Circumvention Period</b>\"), you agree to use the Site and Services as your exclusive method to request, make, and receive all payments for work directly or indirectly with that party or arising out of your relationship with that party (the \"<b>JoBarter Relationship</b>\"). For the avoidance of doubt, if you, or the business you represent, did not identify and were not identified by another party through the Site, such as if you and another User worked together before meeting on the Site, then the Non-Circumvention Period does not apply. If you use the Site as an employee, agent, or representative of another business, then the Non-Circumvention Period applies to you and other employees, agents, or representatives of the business when acting in that capacity with respect to the other User.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Using JoBarter</h2>\r\n <p className=\"pb-2\">\r\nThe User may post or list (\"post,\" and as an act to \"post, \"posting,\" or \"posted\" etc.) information on the Site about potential cases, sales, clients, etc. or any other information posted to the Site (collectively and individually, \"Post Data\") that that the User would like to share with other users of the Site, so long as:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n   <li> the User is authorized to post such Post Data</li>\r\n    <li> the User, the Post Data, and the act of posting the information does not violate this Agreement or other law</li>\r\n    <li> the Post Data is of a nature requested by and appropriate for the Site</li>\r\n    </ol>\r\n <p className=\"pb-2\">The Site provides a means for the User and other users of the Site to ask each other questions related to the Post Data.
