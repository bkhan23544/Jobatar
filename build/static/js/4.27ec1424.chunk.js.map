The Site is intended to assist Users in identifying those who are interested in sending or obtaining Post Data (as defined herein). The Site acts as an online venue.

Services provided through the Site are not guaranteed or warranted and Users must always use caution and common sense when entering into a transaction and always inspect other users.</p>\r\n<p className=\"pb-2\">\r\nJoBarter takes no position and offers no opinion on when or if a contractual agreement or other relationship is formed between the User and other users of the Site or other parties or when delivery occurs. In order to provide an optimal forum for the User, the Site does not involve itself in the agreements between the User and other users of the Site or the actual delivery or provision or delivery of goods or services of the User or other users of the Site, third parties, or any other person or entity. Therefore, the Site cannot ensure the completion of any agreement, representation, warranty, or the integrity of any party. The Site will not be a party to any fee or referral fee dispute or other related legal matter, or claim asserted by or amongst the User or other users of the Site. If the User has a dispute with one or more other users of the Site, the Users release the Site from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n <h2> Modifications to Agreements</h2>\r\n<p className=\"pb-2\">You can see when this Agreement was last updated by viewing the relevant date on the top left of this page.

For the avoidance of doubt, if you, or the business you represent, did not identify and were not identified by another party through the Site, such as if you and another User worked together before meeting on the Site, then the Non-Circumvention Period does not apply. If you use the Site as an employee, agent, or representative of another business, then the Non-Circumvention Period applies to you and other employees, agents, or representatives of the business when acting in that capacity with respect to the other User.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Using JoBarter</h2>\r\n <p className=\"pb-2\">\r\nThe User may post or list (\"post,\" and as an act to \"post, \"posting,\" or \"posted\" etc.) information on the Site about potential cases, sales, clients, etc. or any other information posted to the Site (collectively and individually, \"Post Data\") that that the User would like to share with other users of the Site, so long as:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n   <li> the User is authorized to post such Post Data</li>\r\n    <li> the User, the Post Data, and the act of posting the information does not violate this Agreement or other law</li>\r\n    <li> the Post Data is of a nature requested by and appropriate for the Site</li>\r\n    </ol>\r\n <p className=\"pb-2\">The Site provides a means for the User and other users of the Site to ask each other questions related to the Post Data.

The illegality, invalidity, or unenforceability of such provision in that jurisdiction will not in any way affect the legality, validity, or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction or of any other provision in any jurisdiction.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Waiver</h2>\r\n<p className=\"pb-2\">\r\nIf we fail to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement or other incorporated agreements, that failure shall not be used to prove or be construed that the Site has waived the right or provision. If any provision of this Agreement or other incorporated agreements is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the User nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and that the other provisions of the Agreement remain in full force and effect. </p>\r\n<p className=\"pb-2\">\r\nTHE USER AGREES THAT REGARDLESS OF ANY STATUTE OR LAW TO THE CONTRARY, ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO USE OF THE SITE OR SERVICES OR THE AGREEMENT OR INCORPORATED AGREEMENTS MUST BE FILED BY THE USER OR THIRD PARTY WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER SUCH CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION AROSE OR BE FOREVER BARRED.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Survival</h2>\r\n<p className=\"pb-2\">\r\nAfter this Agreement terminates, the terms of this Agreement and the other Terms of Service that expressly or by their nature contemplate performance after this Agreement terminates or expires will survive and continue in full force and effect. For example, the provisions protecting intellectual property, requiring non-circumvention, indemnification, payment of fees, reimbursement and setting forth limitations of liability each, by their nature, contemplate performance or observance after this Agreement terminates. Without limiting any other provisions of the Terms of Service, the termination of this Agreement for any reason will not release you or JoBarter from any obligations incurred prior to termination of this Agreement or that thereafter may accrue in respect of any act or omission prior to such termination.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Entire Agreement</h2>\r\n<p className=\"pb-2\">\r\nThis Agreement sets forth the entire agreement and understanding between you and JoBarter relating to the subject matter hereof and thereof and cancels and supersedes any prior or contemporaneous discussions, agreements, representations, warranties, and other communications between you and us, written or oral, to the extent they relate in any way to the subject matter hereof and thereof. The section headings in the Terms of Service are included for ease of reference only and have no binding effect. Even though JoBarter drafted the Terms of Service, you represent that you had ample time to review and decide whether to agree to the Terms of Service. </p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Questions About Terms of Service</h2>\r\n<p className=\"pb-2\">\r\nIf you have any questions about our Terms of Service, you can contact us by emailing us at <a href=\"mailto:contact@jobarter.com\">contact@jobarter.com</a>. </p>\r\n              </Col>\r\n                    </Row>\r\n                </Container>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </Main>);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default TermsOfService;\r\n","import React, { Component } from 'react';\r\nimport { Main } from '../../layout';\r\nimport { DocumentTitle } from '../../../helpers/DocumentTitle';\r\nimport { Container, Row, Col } from 'react-bootstrap';\r\n\r\nclass ComingSoon extends Component {\r\n    render() {\r\n        return (<Main>\r\n            <DocumentTitle title={`Coming Soon`} />\r\n            <div className=\"contact-page\" style={{backgroundImage: 'none', }}>\r\n                <Container>\r\n                    <Row>\r\n                        <Col md=\"12\">\r\n                            <h1>Coming Soon...</h1>\r\n                        </Col>\r\n                    </Row>\r\n                </Container>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </Main>);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default ComingSoon;","import { useEffect } from \"react\";\r\nimport { withRouter } from \"react-router-dom\";\r\n\r\nconst ScrollToTop = ({ children, location: { pathname } }) => {\r\n    useEffect(() => {\r\n      window.scrollTo(0, 0);\r\n    }, [pathname]);\r\n\r\n    return children || null;\r\n  };\r\n\r\nexport default withRouter(ScrollToTop);\r\n\r\n","import React, { Component, Fragment } from 'react';\r\nimport { connect } from \"react-redux\";\r\nimport { createSelector } from \"reselect\";\r\nimport { LazyLoadImage } from \"react-lazy-load-image-component\";\r\nimport { NavLink } from \"react-router-dom\";\r\nimport { IconButton, } from '@material-ui/core';\r\nimport { confirmAlert } from 'react-confirm-alert';\r\nimport { alertSelectors } from '../../../../common/redux/selectors';\r\nimport { itemService } from '../../../../common/services';\r\nimport { SearchLoader } from '../../../../common/loaders';\r\n\r\nclass FreelancerListing extends Component {\r\n\r\n    constructor(props) {\r\n        super(props);\r\n        this.state = {\r\n            favorite: {},\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    markAsFavorite = (item) => {\r\n        const { dispatch } = this.props;\r\n        const params = {\r\n            \"userFavorite\": {\r\n                favorite_id: item.id,\r\n                moduleId: \"UserProfile\"\r\n            }\r\n        };\r\n\r\n        let method = (item.is_favorite) ?
