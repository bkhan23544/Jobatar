For the avoidance of doubt, if you, or the business you represent, did not identify and were not identified by another party through the Site, such as if you and another User worked together before meeting on the Site, then the Non-Circumvention Period does not apply. If you use the Site as an employee, agent, or representative of another business, then the Non-Circumvention Period applies to you and other employees, agents, or representatives of the business when acting in that capacity with respect to the other User.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Using JoBarter</h2>\r\n <p className=\"pb-2\">\r\nThe User may post or list (\"post,\" and as an act to \"post, \"posting,\" or \"posted\" etc.) information on the Site about potential cases, sales, clients, etc. or any other information posted to the Site (collectively and individually, \"Post Data\") that that the User would like to share with other users of the Site, so long as:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n   <li> the User is authorized to post such Post Data</li>\r\n    <li> the User, the Post Data, and the act of posting the information does not violate this Agreement or other law</li>\r\n    <li> the Post Data is of a nature requested by and appropriate for the Site</li>\r\n    </ol>\r\n <p className=\"pb-2\">The Site provides a means for the User and other users of the Site to ask each other questions related to the Post Data.
