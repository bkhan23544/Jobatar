 <h2> Purpose</h2>
<p className="pb-2">
JoBarter.com is an Internet-based venue that facilitates communications between Users of the Site (the term "other users of the Site" consists of Users of the Site who, themselves, are also subject to this Agreement as Users) for the purpose of exchanging information. The Site is intended to assist Users in identifying those who are interested in sending or obtaining Post Data (as defined herein). The Site acts as an online venue. The Site does not guarantee that the User will obtain any benefit through the Site nor ensure that the User will actually complete a transaction. Services provided through the Site are not guaranteed or warranted and Users must always use caution and common sense when entering into a transaction and always inspect other users.</p>
<p className="pb-2">
JoBarter takes no position and offers no opinion on when or if a contractual agreement or other relationship is formed between the User and other users of the Site or other parties or when delivery occurs. In order to provide an optimal forum for the User, the Site does not involve itself in the agreements between the User and other users of the Site or the actual delivery or provision or delivery of goods or services of the User or other users of the Site, third parties, or any other person or entity. Therefore, the Site cannot ensure the completion of any agreement, representation, warranty, or the integrity of any party. The Site will not be a party to any fee or referral fee dispute or other related legal matter, or claim asserted by or amongst the User or other users of the Site. If the User has a dispute with one or more other users of the Site, the Users release the Site from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.</p>

<h2>Non-Circumvention</h2>
 <p className="pb-2">
You acknowledge and agree that a substantial portion of the compensation JoBarter receives for making the Site available to you is collected through the Fee described in "Fees" section, below. JoBarter only receives this Service Fee when a Client and a Freelancer pay and receive payment through the Site. Therefore, for 6 months from the time you identify or are identified by any party through the Site (the "<b>Non-Circumvention Period</b>"), you agree to use the Site and Services as your exclusive method to request, make, and receive all payments for work directly or indirectly with that party or arising out of your relationship with that party (the "<b>JoBarter Relationship</b>"). For the avoidance of doubt, if you, or the business you represent, did not identify and were not identified by another party through the Site, such as if you and another User worked together before meeting on the Site, then the Non-Circumvention Period does not apply. If you use the Site as an employee, agent, or representative of another business, then the Non-Circumvention Period applies to you and other employees, agents, or representatives of the business when acting in that capacity with respect to the other User.</p>

<ol>
   <li> the User is authorized to post such Post Data</li>
    <li> the User, the Post Data, and the act of posting the information does not violate this Agreement or other law</li>
    <li> the Post Data is of a nature requested by and appropriate for the Site</li>
    </ol>
 <p className="pb-2">The Site provides a means for the User and other users of the Site to ask each other questions related to the Post Data.

<h2>Severability</h2>
<p className="pb-2">
If and to the extent any provision of this Agreement is held illegal, invalid, or unenforceable in whole or in part under applicable law, such provision or such portion thereof will be ineffective as to the jurisdiction in which it is illegal, invalid, or unenforceable to the extent of its illegality, invalidity, or unenforceability and will be deemed modified to the extent necessary to conform to applicable law so as to give the maximum effect to the intent of the parties. The illegality, invalidity, or unenforceability of such provision in that jurisdiction will not in any way affect the legality, validity, or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction or of any other provision in any jurisdiction.</p>

<h2>Waiver</h2>
<p className="pb-2">
If we fail to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement or other incorporated agreements, that failure shall not be used to prove or be construed that the Site has waived the right or provision. If any provision of this Agreement or other incorporated agreements is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the User nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and that the other provisions of the Agreement remain in full force and effect. </p>
<p className="pb-2">
THE USER AGREES THAT REGARDLESS OF ANY STATUTE OR LAW TO THE CONTRARY, ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO USE OF THE SITE OR SERVICES OR THE AGREEMENT OR INCORPORATED AGREEMENTS MUST BE FILED BY THE USER OR THIRD PARTY WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER SUCH CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION AROSE OR BE FOREVER BARRED.</p>

For example, the provisions protecting intellectual property, requiring non-circumvention, indemnification, payment of fees, reimbursement and setting forth limitations of liability each, by their nature, contemplate performance or observance after this Agreement terminates. Without limiting any other provisions of the Terms of Service, the termination of this Agreement for any reason will not release you or JoBarter from any obligations incurred prior to termination of this Agreement or that thereafter may accrue in respect of any act or omission prior to such termination.</p>
